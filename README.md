# Customer Segmentation Using Clustering Algorithms

This project uses unsupervised machine learning to segment customers into distinct behavioural groups based on purchasing and demographic patterns. The aim is to help businesses tailor marketing strategies and enhance customer engagement through data-driven segmentation.

---

## Project Overview

By applying K-Means and related clustering techniques, this analysis uncovers natural groupings in customer data. These insights can support campaign personalisation, product bundling, and customer lifetime value strategies.

---

## Business Context

In competitive consumer markets, understanding customer behaviour is essential for growth. Segmenting customers helps businesses:
- Target campaigns to specific customer needs
- Increase retention by aligning services with user preferences
- Allocate marketing resources more efficiently

---

## Objectives

- Preprocess and scale customer data
- Apply K-Means clustering and silhouette analysis
- Visualise segment patterns across key behavioural features
- Translate clusters into actionable business segments

---

## Tools and Libraries

- Python, pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn, KMeans, PCA, tSNE

---

## Results Summary

- Identified 4 customer segments with distinct profiles (e.g. high-value, frequent buyers vs. low-frequency deal-seekers)
- Used PCA and tSNE to reduce dimensionality for clear visualisation
- Provided strategic recommendations for each group to support marketing and retention

---

## Limitations

- Clusters are only as good as the input features; domain expertise is needed to refine
- Static dataset; results should be validated against future behaviour

---

## Next Steps

- Integrate cluster labels into CRM or marketing systems
- Test performance of targeted campaigns against control groups
- Explore other clustering techniques (e.g. DBSCAN, Hierarchical)
